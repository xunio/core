  What is it?
  -----------

  The xun.io is a set of Haxe libraries split into multiple (hopefully logical
  grouped) packages.

     o xun.io.core

       Implementation of basic recommended design patterns and high level
       libraries for basic operations, as well as helper classes for data
       manipulation, such as and inflector or lambda class.

       The aim is to implement following patterns:

          o Creational Design Patterns
               o abstract factory
               o factory method (interface)
               o signleton (interface)
               o multition (interface)

          o Structural Design Patterns
               o decorator

          o Behavioral Design Patterns
               o observer
               o interceptor
               o state
               o token

          o other
               o dependency injection

     o others will follow...


  The xun.io project aim is to build an web framework for scalable,
  high performance web applications that shares code with the frontend
  application (e.g. the browser).  For this reason xun.io can be compiled
  to C++ to reach near native performance and to JavaScript to use high level
  API's in the frontend application.

  The Latest Version
  ------------------

  Details of the latest version can be found on the xun.io
  project page under http://xun.io.

  Documentation
  -------------

  There is currently no real documentation. Please see the unit tests
  in 'test/src'.  In order to run the tests successfully you have to
  setup and build environment like described in the 'Installation' section

  Installation
  ------------

  xun.io is currently tested with the following Haxe targets:

     o Linux 3.10.5 x86_64
          o C++ with gcc version 4.8.1 20130725 (prerelease)
          o JavaScript with nodejs version 0.10.17
          o neko with NekoVM version 2.0.0
          o PHP with PHP CLI 5.5.3

  In order to build the software you have to install the following packages:

     o haxe >= 3.0.0
     o neko >= 2.0.0

  For the C++ target:

     o hxcpp >= 3.0.2
     o gcc >= 4.8.1 (older versions mind work also)

  For the JavaScript target:

     o node >= 0.10.17 (older versions mind work also)

  For the PHP target:

     o php >= 5.5.3 (older versions mind work also)

  To build the tests simply run the script 'test.sh' in the project root.  If
  you run it with the argument 'total' (e.g. 'test.sh total') old binaries
  gets purged before building.
